# MindONE

This repository contains SoTA algorithms, models, and interesting projects in the area of content generation, including ChatGPT detection and Stable Diffusion, and will be continously updated.

ONE is short for "ONE for all" and "Optimal generators with No Exception" (credits to GPT-4).
## News
- 2023.07.01 stable diffusion 2.0 lora fine-tune example can be found [here](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindone/blob/master/examples/stable_diffusion_v2/lora_finetune.md)

## Playground

- [ChatGPT Detection](examples/detect_chatgpt): Detect whether the input texts are generated by ChatGPT

- [Stable Diffusion 1.5/2.x](examples/stable_diffusion_v2): Text-to-image generation via latent diffusion models (with support for inference and finetuning)

- [Stable Diffusion XL](examples/stable_diffusion_xl): New state-of-the-art SD model with double text embedders and larger UNet.

- [VideoComposer](examples/videocomposer): Genearte videos with prompts or reference videos via controllable video diffusion (both training and inference are supported)

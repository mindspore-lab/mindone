# Stable Diffusion 3

Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) was proposed in [Scaling Rectified Flow Transformers for High-Resolution Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03206.pdf) by Patrick Esser, Sumith Kulal, Andreas Blattmann, Rahim Entezari, Jonas Muller, Harry Saini, Yam Levi, Dominik Lorenz, Axel Sauer, Frederic Boesel, Dustin Podell, Tim Dockhorn, Zion English, Kyle Lacey, Alex Goodwin, Yannik Marek, and Robin Rombach.

The abstract from the paper is:

*Diffusion models create data from noise by inverting the forward paths of data towards noise and have emerged as a powerful generative modeling technique for high-dimensional, perceptual data such as images and videos. Rectified flow is a recent generative model formulation that connects data and noise in a straight line. Despite its better theoretical properties and conceptual simplicity, it is not yet decisively established as standard practice. In this work, we improve existing noise sampling techniques for training rectified flow models by biasing them towards perceptually relevant scales. Through a large-scale study, we demonstrate the superior performance of this approach compared to established diffusion formulations for high-resolution text-to-image synthesis. Additionally, we present a novel transformer-based architecture for text-to-image generation that uses separate weights for the two modalities and enables a bidirectional flow of information between image and text tokens, improving text comprehension typography, and human preference ratings. We demonstrate that this architecture follows predictable scaling trends and correlates lower validation loss to improved text-to-image synthesis as measured by various metrics and human evaluations.*

## Usage Example

_As the model is gated, before using it with diffusers you first need to go to the [Stable Diffusion 3 Medium Hugging Face page](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3-medium-diffusers), fill in the form and accept the gate. Once you are in, you need to login so that your system knows you’ve accepted the gate._

Use the command below to log in:

```bash
huggingface-cli login
```

!!! tip

    The SD3 pipeline uses three text encoders to generate an image. Model offloading is necessary in order for it to run on most commodity hardware. Please use the `ms.float16` data type for additional memory savings.

```python
import mindspore as ms
from mindone.diffusers import StableDiffusion3Pipeline

pipe = StableDiffusion3Pipeline.from_pretrained("stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3-medium-diffusers", mindspore_dtype=ms.float16)

image = pipe(
    prompt="a photo of a cat holding a sign that says hello world",
    negative_prompt="",
    num_inference_steps=28,
    height=1024,
    width=1024,
    guidance_scale=7.0,
)[0][0]

image.save("sd3_hello_world.png")
```

### Dropping the T5 Text Encoder during Inference

Removing the memory-intensive 4.7B parameter T5-XXL text encoder during inference can significantly decrease the memory requirements for SD3 with only a slight loss in performance.

```python
import mindspore as ms
from mindone.diffusers import StableDiffusion3Pipeline

pipe = StableDiffusion3Pipeline.from_pretrained(
    "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3-medium-diffusers",
    text_encoder_3=None,
    tokenizer_3=None,
    mindspore_dtype=ms.float16
)

image = pipe(
    prompt="a photo of a cat holding a sign that says hello world",
    negative_prompt="",
    num_inference_steps=28,
    height=1024,
    width=1024,
    guidance_scale=7.0,
)[0][0]

image.save("sd3_hello_world-no-T5.png")
```

## Using Long Prompts with the T5 Text Encoder

By default, the T5 Text Encoder prompt uses a maximum sequence length of `256`. This can be adjusted by setting the `max_sequence_length` to accept fewer or more tokens. Keep in mind that longer sequences require additional resources and result in longer generation times, such as during batch inference.

```python
prompt = "A whimsical and creative image depicting a hybrid creature that is a mix of a waffle and a hippopotamus, basking in a river of melted butter amidst a breakfast-themed landscape. It features the distinctive, bulky body shape of a hippo. However, instead of the usual grey skin, the creature’s body resembles a golden-brown, crispy waffle fresh off the griddle. The skin is textured with the familiar grid pattern of a waffle, each square filled with a glistening sheen of syrup. The environment combines the natural habitat of a hippo with elements of a breakfast table setting, a river of warm, melted butter, with oversized utensils or plates peeking out from the lush, pancake-like foliage in the background, a towering pepper mill standing in for a tree.  As the sun rises in this fantastical world, it casts a warm, buttery glow over the scene. The creature, content in its butter river, lets out a yawn. Nearby, a flock of birds take flight"

image = pipe(
    prompt=prompt,
    negative_prompt="",
    num_inference_steps=28,
    guidance_scale=4.5,
    max_sequence_length=512,
)[0][0]
```

### Sending a different prompt to the T5 Text Encoder

You can send a different prompt to the CLIP Text Encoders and the T5 Text Encoder to prevent the prompt from being truncated by the CLIP Text Encoders and to improve generation.

!!! tip

    The prompt with the CLIP Text Encoders is still truncated to the 77 token limit.

```python
prompt = "A whimsical and creative image depicting a hybrid creature that is a mix of a waffle and a hippopotamus, basking in a river of melted butter amidst a breakfast-themed landscape. A river of warm, melted butter, pancake-like foliage in the background, a towering pepper mill standing in for a tree."

prompt_3 = "A whimsical and creative image depicting a hybrid creature that is a mix of a waffle and a hippopotamus, basking in a river of melted butter amidst a breakfast-themed landscape. It features the distinctive, bulky body shape of a hippo. However, instead of the usual grey skin, the creature’s body resembles a golden-brown, crispy waffle fresh off the griddle.

image = pipe(
    prompt=prompt,
    prompt_3=prompt_3,
    negative_prompt="",
    num_inference_steps=28,
    guidance_scale=4.5,
    max_sequence_length=512,
)[0][0]
```

## Tiny AutoEncoder for Stable Diffusion 3

Tiny AutoEncoder for Stable Diffusion (TAESD3) is a tiny distilled version of Stable Diffusion 3's VAE by [Ollin Boer Bohan](https://github.com/madebyollin/taesd) that can decode [`StableDiffusion3Pipeline`](#mindone.diffusers.StableDiffusion3Pipeline) latents almost instantly.

To use with Stable Diffusion 3:

```python
import mindspore
from mindone.diffusers import StableDiffusion3Pipeline, AutoencoderTiny

pipe = StableDiffusion3Pipeline.from_pretrained(
    "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3-medium-diffusers", mindspore_dtype=mindspore.float16
)
pipe.vae = AutoencoderTiny.from_pretrained("madebyollin/taesd3", mindspore_dtype=mindspore.float16)

prompt = "slice of delicious New York-style berry cheesecake"
image = pipe(prompt, num_inference_steps=25)[0][0]
image.save("cheesecake.png")
```

## Loading the original checkpoints via `from_single_file`

The `SD3Transformer2DModel` and `StableDiffusion3Pipeline` classes support loading the original checkpoints via the `from_single_file` method. This method allows you to load the original checkpoint files that were used to train the models.

## Loading the original checkpoints for the `SD3Transformer2DModel`

```python
from mindone.diffusers import SD3Transformer2DModel

model = SD3Transformer2DModel.from_single_file("https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3-medium/blob/main/sd3_medium.safetensors")
```

## Loading the single checkpoint for the `StableDiffusion3Pipeline`

### Loading the single file checkpoint without T5

```python
import mindspore as ms
from mindone.diffusers import StableDiffusion3Pipeline

pipe = StableDiffusion3Pipeline.from_single_file(
    "https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3-medium/blob/main/sd3_medium_incl_clips.safetensors",
    mindspore_dtype=ms.float16,
    text_encoder_3=None
)

image = pipe("a picture of a cat holding a sign that says hello world").images[0]
image.save('sd3-single-file.png')
```

### Loading the single file checkpoint without T5

```python
import mindspore as ms
from mindone.diffusers import StableDiffusion3Pipeline

pipe = StableDiffusion3Pipeline.from_single_file(
    "https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3-medium/blob/main/sd3_medium_incl_clips_t5xxlfp8.safetensors",
    mindspore_dtype=ms.float16,
)

image = pipe("a picture of a cat holding a sign that says hello world")[0][0]
image.save('sd3-single-file-t5-fp8.png')
```

# GLIGEN (Grounded Language-to-Image Generation)

The GLIGEN model was created by researchers and engineers from [University of Wisconsin-Madison, Columbia University, and Microsoft](https://github.com/gligen/GLIGEN). The [`StableDiffusionGLIGENPipeline`](https://mindspore-lab.github.io/mindone/latest/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion/gligen/#mindone.diffusers.StableDiffusionGLIGENPipeline) and [`StableDiffusionGLIGENTextImagePipeline`](https://mindspore-lab.github.io/mindone/latest/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion/gligen/#mindone.diffusers.StableDiffusionGLIGENTextImagePipeline) can generate photorealistic images conditioned on grounding inputs. Along with text and bounding boxes with [`StableDiffusionGLIGENPipeline`](https://mindspore-lab.github.io/mindone/latest/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion/gligen/#mindone.diffusers.StableDiffusionGLIGENPipeline), if input images are given, [`StableDiffusionGLIGENTextImagePipeline`](https://mindspore-lab.github.io/mindone/latest/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion/gligen/#mindone.diffusers.StableDiffusionGLIGENTextImagePipeline) can insert objects described by text at the region defined by bounding boxes. Otherwise, it'll generate an image described by the caption/prompt and insert objects described by text at the region defined by bounding boxes. It's trained on COCO2014D and COCO2014CD datasets, and the model uses a frozen CLIP ViT-L/14 text encoder to condition itself on grounding inputs.

The abstract from the [paper](https://huggingface.co/papers/2301.07093) is:

*Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have made amazing advances. However, the status quo is to use text input alone, which can impede controllability. In this work, we propose GLIGEN, Grounded-Language-to-Image Generation, a novel approach that builds upon and extends the functionality of existing pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models by enabling them to also be conditioned on grounding inputs. To preserve the vast concept knowledge of the pre-trained model, we freeze all of its weights and inject the grounding information into new trainable layers via a gated mechanism. Our model achieves open-world grounded text2img generation with caption and bounding box condition inputs, and the grounding ability generalizes well to novel spatial configurations and concepts. GLIGENâ€™s zeroshot performance on COCO and LVIS outperforms existing supervised layout-to-image baselines by a large margin.*

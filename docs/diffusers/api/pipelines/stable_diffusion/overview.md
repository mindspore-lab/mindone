# Stable Diffusion pipelines

Stable Diffusion is a text-to-image latent diffusion model created by the researchers and engineers from [CompVis](https://github.com/CompVis), [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/) and [LAION](https://laion.ai/). Latent diffusion applies the diffusion process over a lower dimensional latent space to reduce memory and compute complexity. This specific type of diffusion model was proposed in [High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models](https://huggingface.co/papers/2112.10752) by Robin Rombach, Andreas Blattmann, Dominik Lorenz, Patrick Esser, BjÃ¶rn Ommer.

Stable Diffusion is trained on 512x512 images from a subset of the LAION-5B dataset. This model uses a frozen CLIP ViT-L/14 text encoder to condition the model on text prompts. With its 860M UNet and 123M text encoder, the model is relatively lightweight.

For more details about how Stable Diffusion works and how it differs from the base latent diffusion model, take a look at the Stability AI [announcement](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-announcement) and our own [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/stable_diffusion#how-does-stable-diffusion-work) for more technical details.

You can find the original codebase for Stable Diffusion v1.0 at [CompVis/stable-diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion) and Stable Diffusion v2.0 at [Stability-AI/stablediffusion](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion) as well as their original scripts for various tasks. Additional official checkpoints for the different Stable Diffusion versions and tasks can be found on the [CompVis](https://huggingface.co/CompVis), [Runway](https://huggingface.co/runwayml), and [Stability AI](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai) Hub organizations. Explore these organizations to find the best checkpoint for your use-case!

## Tips

To help you get the most out of the Stable Diffusion pipelines, here are a few tips for improving performance and usability. These tips are applicable to all Stable Diffusion pipelines.

### Explore tradeoff between speed and quality

[`StableDiffusionPipeline`](https://mindspore-lab.github.io/mindone/latest/diffusers/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion/text2img/#mindone.diffusers.StableDiffusionPipeline) uses the [`PNDMScheduler`](https://mindspore-lab.github.io/mindone/latest/diffusers/api/schedulers/pndm/#mindone.diffusers.PNDMScheduler) by default, but ðŸ¤— Diffusers provides many other schedulers (some of which are faster or output better quality) that are compatible. For example, if you want to use the [`EulerDiscreteScheduler`](https://mindspore-lab.github.io/mindone/latest/diffusers/api/schedulers/euler/#mindone.diffusers.EulerDiscreteScheduler) instead of the default:

```py
from mindone.diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline, EulerDiscreteScheduler

pipeline = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4")
pipeline.scheduler = EulerDiscreteScheduler.from_config(pipeline.scheduler.config)

# or
euler_scheduler = EulerDiscreteScheduler.from_pretrained("CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4", subfolder="scheduler")
pipeline = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4", scheduler=euler_scheduler)
```

### Reuse pipeline components to save memory

To save memory and use the same components across multiple pipelines, use the `.components` method to avoid loading weights into RAM more than once.

```py
from mindone.diffusers import (
    StableDiffusionPipeline,
    StableDiffusionImg2ImgPipeline,
    StableDiffusionInpaintPipeline,
)

text2img = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4")
img2img = StableDiffusionImg2ImgPipeline(**text2img.components)
inpaint = StableDiffusionInpaintPipeline(**text2img.components)

# now you can use text2img(...), img2img(...), inpaint(...) just like the call methods of each respective pipeline
```

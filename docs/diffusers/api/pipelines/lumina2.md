[Lumina Image 2.0: A Unified and Efficient Image Generative Model](https://huggingface.co/Alpha-VLLM/Lumina-Image-2.0) is a 2 billion parameter flow-based diffusion transformer capable of generating diverse images from text descriptions.

The abstract from the paper is:

*We introduce Lumina-Image 2.0, an advanced text-to-image model that surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, while also shedding light on its potential to evolve into a generalist vision intelligence model. Lumina-Image 2.0 exhibits three key properties: (1) Unification – it adopts a unified architecture that treats text and image tokens as a joint sequence, enabling natural cross-modal interactions and facilitating task expansion. Besides, since high-quality captioners can provide semantically better-aligned text-image training pairs, we introduce a unified captioning system, UniCaptioner, which generates comprehensive and precise captions for the model. This not only accelerates model convergence but also enhances prompt adherence, variable-length prompt handling, and task generalization via prompt templates. (2) Efficiency – to improve the efficiency of the unified architecture, we develop a set of optimization techniques that improve semantic learning and fine-grained texture generation during training while incorporating inference-time acceleration strategies without compromising image quality. (3) Transparency – we open-source all training details, code, and models to ensure full reproducibility, aiming to bridge the gap between well-resourced closed-source research teams and independent developers.*

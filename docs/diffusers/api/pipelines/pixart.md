The abstract from the paper is:

*The most advanced text-to-image (T2I) models require significant training costs (e.g., millions of GPU hours), seriously hindering the fundamental innovation for the AIGC community while increasing CO2 emissions. This paper introduces PIXART-α, a Transformer-based T2I diffusion model whose image generation quality is competitive with state-of-the-art image generators (e.g., Imagen, SDXL, and even Midjourney), reaching near-commercial application standards. Additionally, it supports high-resolution image synthesis up to 1024px resolution with low training cost, as shown in Figure 1 and 2. To achieve this goal, three core designs are proposed: (1) Training strategy decomposition: We devise three distinct training steps that separately optimize pixel dependency, text-image alignment, and image aesthetic quality; (2) Efficient T2I Transformer: We incorporate cross-attention modules into Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to inject text conditions and streamline the computation-intensive class-condition branch; (3) High-informative data: We emphasize the significance of concept density in text-image pairs and leverage a large Vision-Language model to auto-label dense pseudo-captions to assist text-image alignment learning. As a result, PIXART-α's training speed markedly surpasses existing large-scale T2I models, e.g., PIXART-α only takes 10.8% of Stable Diffusion v1.5's training time (675 vs. 6,250 A100 GPU days), saving nearly $300,000 ($26,000 vs. $320,000) and reducing 90% CO2 emissions. Moreover, compared with a larger SOTA model, RAPHAEL, our training cost is merely 1%. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PIXART-α excels in image quality, artistry, and semantic control. We hope PIXART-α will provide new insights to the AIGC community and startups to accelerate building their own high-quality yet low-cost generative models from scratch.*

Some notes about this pipeline:

* It uses a Transformer backbone (instead of a UNet) for denoising. As such it has a similar architecture as [DiT](dit.md).
* It was trained using text conditions computed from T5. This aspect makes the pipeline better at following complex text prompts with intricate details.
* It is good at producing high-resolution images at different aspect ratios. To get the best results, the authors recommend some size brackets which can be found [here](https://github.com/PixArt-alpha/PixArt-alpha/blob/08fbbd281ec96866109bdd2cdb75f2f58fb17610/diffusion/data/datasets/utils.py).
* It rivals the quality of state-of-the-art text-to-image generation systems (as of this writing) such as Stable Diffusion XL, Imagen, and DALL-E 2, while being more efficient than them.

    Make sure to check out the Schedulers [guide](../../using-diffusers/schedulers.md) to learn how to explore the tradeoff between scheduler speed and quality, and see the [reuse components across pipelines](../../using-diffusers/loading.md) section to learn how to efficiently load the same components into multiple pipelines.


## Inference Pipeline

Let's walk through a full-fledged example to run the [`PixArtAlphaPipeline`](pixart.md#mindone.diffusers.PixArtAlphaPipeline).

```python
import mindspore as ms
from mindone.diffusers import PixArtAlphaPipeline

pipe = PixArtAlphaPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "PixArt-alpha/PixArt-XL-2-1024-MS",
    mindspore_dtype=ms.float16,
)

prompt = "cute cat"
image = pipe(prompt)[0][0]
image.save("image.png")
```

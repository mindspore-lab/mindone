# Allegro

[Allegro: Open the Black Box of Commercial-Level Video Generation Model](https://huggingface.co/papers/2410.15458) from RhymesAI, by Yuan Zhou, Qiuyue Wang, Yuxuan Cai, Huan Yang.

The abstract from the paper is:

*Significant advancements have been made in the field of video generation, with the open-source community contributing a wealth of research papers and tools for training high-quality models. However, despite these efforts, the available information and resources remain insufficient for achieving commercial-level performance. In this report, we open the black box and introduce Allegro, an advanced video generation model that excels in both quality and temporal consistency. We also highlight the current limitations in the field and present a comprehensive methodology for training high-performance, commercial-level video generation models, addressing key aspects such as data, model architecture, training pipeline, and evaluation. Our user study shows that Allegro surpasses existing open-source models and most commercial models, ranking just behind Hailuo and Kling.

    Make sure to check out the Schedulers [guide](../../using-diffusers/schedulers.md) to learn how to explore the tradeoff between scheduler speed and quality, and see the [reuse components across pipelines](../../using-diffusers/loading.md#reuse-a-pipeline) section to learn how to efficiently load the same components into multiple pipelines.

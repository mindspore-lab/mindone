# Pipelines

Pipelines provide a simple way to run state-of-the-art diffusion models in inference by bundling all of the necessary components (multiple independently-trained models, schedulers, and processors) into a single end-to-end class. Pipelines are flexible and they can be adapted to use different schedulers or even model components.

All pipelines are built from the base [`DiffusionPipeline`](overview.md#mindone.diffusers.DiffusionPipeline) class which provides basic functionality for loading, downloading, and saving all the components. Specific pipeline types (for example [`StableDiffusionPipeline`](stable_diffusion/text2img.md)) loaded with [`DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained`](overview.md#mindone.diffusers.DiffusionPipeline) are automatically detected and the pipeline components are loaded and passed to the `__init__` function of the pipeline.

!!! warning

	You shouldn't use the [`DiffusionPipeline`](overview.md#mindone.diffusers.DiffusionPipeline) class for training. Individual components (for example, [`UNet2DModel`](../models/unet2d.md) and [`UNet2DConditionModel`](../models/unet2d-cond.md)) of diffusion pipelines are usually trained individually, so we suggest directly working with them instead.

!!! warning

	Pipelines do not offer any training functionality. You'll notice MindSpore's autograd is disabled by decorating the [`DiffusionPipeline.__call__`](overview.md#mindone.diffusers.DiffusionPipeline) method with a [`mindspore._no_grad`] decorator because pipelines should not be used for training. If you're interested in training, please take a look at the [Training](../../training/overview.md) guides instead!

# AuraFlow

AuraFlow is inspired by [Stable Diffusion 3](../pipelines/stable_diffusion/stable_diffusion_3.md) and is by far the largest text-to-image generation model that comes with an Apache 2.0 license. This model achieves state-of-the-art results on the [GenEval](https://github.com/djghosh13/geneval) benchmark.

It was developed by the Fal team and more details about it can be found in [this blog post](https://blog.fal.ai/auraflow/).

!!! tip

    AuraFlow can be quite expensive to run on consumer hardware devices. However, you can perform a suite of optimizations to run it faster and in a more memory-friendly manner. Check out [this section](https://huggingface.co/blog/sd3#memory-optimizations-for-sd3) for more details.

Qwen-Image from the Qwen team is an image generation foundation model in the Qwen series that achieves significant advances in complex text rendering and precise image editing. Experiments show strong general capabilities in both image generation and editing, with exceptional performance in text rendering, especially for Chinese.

Qwen-Image comes in the following variants:

| model type | model id |
|:----------:|:--------:|
| Qwen-Image | [`Qwen/Qwen-Image`](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen-Image) |
| Qwen-Image-Edit | [`Qwen/Qwen-Image-Edit`](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen-Image-Edit) |

!!! tip

    Make sure to check out the Schedulers [guide](../../using-diffusers/schedulers) to learn how to explore the tradeoff between scheduler speed and quality, and see the [reuse components across pipelines](../../using-diffusers/loading#reuse-a-pipeline) section to learn how to efficiently load the same components into multiple pipelines.

## LoRA for faster inference

Use a LoRA from `lightx2v/Qwen-Image-Lightning` to speed up inference by reducing the
number of steps. Refer to the code snippet below:

```py
from mindone.diffusers import DiffusionPipeline, FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler
import mindspore
import math

scheduler_config = {
    "base_image_seq_len": 256,
    "base_shift": math.log(3),  # We use shift=3 in distillation
    "invert_sigmas": False,
    "max_image_seq_len": 8192,
    "max_shift": math.log(3),  # We use shift=3 in distillation
    "num_train_timesteps": 1000,
    "shift": 1.0,
    "shift_terminal": None,  # set shift_terminal to None
    "stochastic_sampling": False,
    "time_shift_type": "exponential",
    "use_beta_sigmas": False,
    "use_dynamic_shifting": True,
    "use_exponential_sigmas": False,
    "use_karras_sigmas": False,
}
scheduler = FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler.from_config(scheduler_config)
pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen-Image", scheduler=scheduler, mindspore_dtype=mindspore.bfloat16
)
pipe.load_lora_weights(
    "Qwen/lightx2v/Qwen-Image-Lightning",
    weight_name="Qwen-Image-Lightning-8steps-V1.0.safetensors",
    adapter_name="qwenimage-lora"
)
pipe.fuse_lora()
pipe.unload_lora_weights()

prompt = "a tiny astronaut hatching from an egg on the moon, Ultra HD, 4K, cinematic composition."
negative_prompt = " "
image = pipe(
    prompt=prompt,
    negative_prompt=negative_prompt,
    width=1024,
    height=1024,
    num_inference_steps=8,
    true_cfg_scale=1.0,
    generator=None,
)[0][0]
image.save("lora_pic/qwen_fewsteps_lora.png")
```

!!! tip

    The `guidance_scale` parameter in the pipeline is there to support future guidance-distilled models when they come up.
    Note that passing `guidance_scale` to the pipeline is ineffective. To enable classifier-free guidance, please pass `true_cfg_scale` and `negative_prompt` (even an empty negative prompt like " ") should enable classifier-free guidance computations.

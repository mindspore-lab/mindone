# Make ðŸ¤— DðŸ§¨ffusers Run on MindSpore

</div>

> State-of-the-art diffusion models for image and audio generation in MindSpore.
> We've tried to provide a completely consistent interface and usage with the [huggingface/diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers).
> Only necessary changes are made to the [huggingface/diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) to make it seamless for users from torch.

???+ info

    Due to differences in framework, some APIs will not be identical to [huggingface/diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) in the foreseeable future, see [Limitations](./limitations.md) for details.


# Diffusers

Diffusers is a library of state-of-the-art pretrained diffusion models for generating videos, images, and audio.

The library revolves around the [`DiffusionPipeline`], an API designed for:

- easy inference with only a few lines of code
- flexibility to mix-and-match pipeline components (models, schedulers)
- loading and using adapters like LoRA

Diffusers also comes with optimizations - such as offloading and quantization - to ensure even the largest models are accessible on memory-constrained devices. If memory is not an issue, Diffusers supports torch.compile to boost inference speed.

Get started right away with a Diffusers model on the [Hub](https://huggingface.co/models?library=diffusers&sort=trending) today!

## Learn

If you're a beginner, we recommend starting with the [Hugging Face Diffusion Models Course](https://huggingface.co/learn/diffusion-course/unit0/1). You'll learn the theory behind diffusion models, and learn how to use the Diffusers library to generate images, fine-tune your own models, and more.

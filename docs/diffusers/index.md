# Make ðŸ¤— DðŸ§¨ffusers Run on MindSpore

</div>

> State-of-the-art diffusion models for image and audio generation in MindSpore.
> We've tried to provide a completely consistent interface and usage with the [huggingface/diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers).
> Only necessary changes are made to the [huggingface/diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) to make it seamless for users from torch.

???+ info

    Due to differences in framework, some APIs will not be identical to [huggingface/diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) in the foreseeable future, see [Limitations](./limitations) for details.


ðŸ¤— Diffusers is the go-to library for state-of-the-art pretrained diffusion models for generating images, audio, and even 3D structures of molecules. Whether you're looking for a simple inference solution or want to train your own diffusion model, ðŸ¤— Diffusers is a modular toolbox that supports both. Our library is designed with a focus on [usability over performance](conceptual/philosophy#usability-over-performance), [simple over easy](conceptual/philosophy#simple-over-easy), and [customizability over abstractions](conceptual/philosophy#tweakable-contributorfriendly-over-abstraction).

The library has three main components:

- State-of-the-art diffusion pipelines for inference with just a few lines of code. There are many pipelines in ðŸ¤— Diffusers, check out the table in the pipeline [overview](api/pipelines/overview) for a complete list of available pipelines and the task they solve.
- Interchangeable [noise schedulers](api/schedulers/overview) for balancing trade-offs between generation speed and quality.
- Pretrained [models](api/models) that can be used as building blocks, and combined with schedulers, for creating your own end-to-end diffusion systems.

# Models

ðŸ¤— Diffusers provides pretrained models for popular algorithms and modules to create custom diffusion systems. The primary function of models is to denoise an input sample as modeled by the distribution p<sub>{&theta;}</sub>(x<sub>{t-1}</sub>|x<sub>{t}</sub>)

All models are built from the base [`ModelMixin`](overview.md#mindone.diffusers.ModelMixin) class which is a [`mindspore.nn.Cell`](https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/api_python/nn/mindspore.nn.Cell.html?highlight=cell#mindspore.nn.Cell) providing basic functionality for saving and loading models, locally and from the Hugging Face Hub.

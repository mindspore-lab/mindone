# Overview

ü§ó Diffusers provides a collection of training scripts for you to train your own diffusion models. You can find all of our training scripts in [diffusers/examples](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindone/tree/master/examples/diffusers).

Each training script is:

- **Self-contained**: the training script does not depend on any local files, and all packages required to run the script are installed from the `requirements.txt` file.
- **Easy-to-tweak**: the training scripts are an example of how to train a diffusion model for a specific task and won't work out-of-the-box for every training scenario. You'll likely need to adapt the training script for your specific use-case. To help you with that, we've fully exposed the data preprocessing code and the training loop so you can modify it for your own use.
- **Beginner-friendly**: the training scripts are designed to be beginner-friendly and easy to understand, rather than including the latest state-of-the-art methods to get the best and most competitive results. Any training methods we consider too complex are purposefully left out.
- **Single-purpose**: each training script is expressly designed for only one task to keep it readable and understandable.

Our current collection of training scripts include:

| Training | SDXL-support | LoRA-support |
|---|---|---|
| [unconditional image generation](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindone/tree/master/examples/diffusers/unconditional_image_generation) |  |  |
| [text-to-image](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindone/tree/master/examples/diffusers/text_to_image) | üëç | üëç |
| [textual inversion](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindone/tree/master/examples/diffusers/textual_inversion) |  |  |
| [DreamBooth](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindone/tree/master/examples/diffusers/dreambooth) | üëç | üëç |
| [ControlNet](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindone/tree/master/examples/diffusers/controlnet) | üëç |  |

These examples are **actively** maintained, so please feel free to open an issue if they aren't working as expected. If you feel like another training example should be included, you're more than welcome to start a [Feature Request](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindone/issues/new?assignees=zhanghuiyao&labels=rfc&projects=&template=feature_request.md&title=) to discuss your feature idea with us and whether it meets our criteria of being self-contained, easy-to-tweak, beginner-friendly, and single-purpose.

## Install

Make sure you can successfully run the latest versions of the example scripts by installing the library from source in a new virtual environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindone.git
cd mindone
pip install .
```

Then navigate to the folder of the training script (for example, [DreamBooth](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindone/tree/master/examples/diffusers/dreambooth)) and install the `requirements.txt` file. Some training scripts have a specific requirement file for SDXL, LoRA or Flax. If you're using one of these scripts, make sure you install its corresponding requirements file.

```bash
cd examples/diffusers/dreambooth
pip install -r requirements_sd3.txt
```

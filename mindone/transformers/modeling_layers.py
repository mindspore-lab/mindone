class GradientCheckpointingLayer(nn.Cell):
    """Base class for layers with gradient checkpointing.

    This class enables gradient checkpointing functionality for a layer. By default, gradient checkpointing is disabled
    (`gradient_checkpointing = False`). When `model.set_gradient_checkpointing()` is called, gradient checkpointing is
    enabled by setting `gradient_checkpointing = True` and assigning a checkpointing function to `_gradient_checkpointing_func`.

    Important:

        When using gradient checkpointing with `use_reentrant=True`, inputs that require gradients (e.g. hidden states)
        must be passed as positional arguments (`*args`) rather than keyword arguments to properly propagate gradients.

        Example:

            ```python
            >>> # Correct - hidden_states passed as positional arg
            >>> out = self.layer(hidden_states, attention_mask=attention_mask)

            >>> # Incorrect - hidden_states passed as keyword arg
            >>> out = self.layer(hidden_states=hidden_states, attention_mask=attention_mask)
            ```
    """

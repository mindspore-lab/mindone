    r"""Calculate the Inception Score (IS) which is used to access how realistic generated images are.

    .. math::
        IS = exp(\mathbb{E}_x KL(p(y | x ) || p(y)))

    where :math:`KL(p(y | x) || p(y))` is the KL divergence between the conditional distribution :math:`p(y|x)`
    and the marginal distribution :math:`p(y)`. Both the conditional and marginal distribution is calculated
    from features extracted from the images. The score is calculated on random splits of the images such that
    both a mean and standard deviation of the score are returned. The metric was originally proposed in
    `inception ref1`_.

    Using the default feature extraction (Inception v3 using the original weights from `inception ref2`_), the input
    is expected to be mini-batches of 3-channel RGB images of shape ``(3xHxW)``. If argument ``normalize``
    is ``True`` images are expected to be dtype ``float`` and have values in the ``[0,1]`` range, else if
    ``normalize`` is set to ``False`` images are expected to have dtype uint8 and take values in the ``[0, 255]``
    range. All images will be resized to 299 x 299 which is the size of the original training data.

    .. note:: using this metric with the default feature extractor requires connection with URL:
        https://github.com/toshas/torch-fidelity/releases/download/v0.2.0/weights-inception-2015-12-05-6726825d.pth
        weights will be automatically transferred with script 'convert_inception_weights.py'

    Args:
        images: Input img tensors to evaluate.

        feature:
            an integer:

            - an integer will indicate the inceptionv3 feature layer to choose. Can be one of the following:
              64, 192, 768, 2048

        batch_size: batch size to separate the input data

        normalize:
            Argument for controlling the input image dtype normalization:

            - Controls whether input imgs have values in range [0, 1] or not:

              - True: if input imgs have values ranged in [0, 1]. They are cast to int8/byte tensors.
              - False: if input imgs have values ranged in [0, 255]. No casting is done.

        splits: integer determining how many splits the inception score calculation should be split among

    Returns:
        - ``inception_mean`` (:class:`~mindspore.Tensor`): float scalar tensor with mean inception score over subsets
        - ``inception_std`` (:class:`~mindspore.Tensor`): float scalar tensor with standard deviation of inception score
          over subsets

    Raises:
        ValueError:
            If ``feature`` is set to an ``str`` or ``int`` and not one of ``('logits_unbiased', 64, 192, 768, 2048)``
        TypeError:
            If ``feature`` is not an ``str``, ``int``

    Examples:
        >>> import mindspore as ms
        >>> from mindone.metrics.functional import inception_score
        >>>  # splits equals to 1 to avoid shuffle operation generating different results
        >>> imgs = ms.ops.randint(0, 255, (100, 3, 299, 299), seed=123).to(ms.uint8)
        >>> inception_score(imgs, splits=1)
        (Tensor(shape=[], dtype=Float32, value= 1.06732), Tensor(shape=[], dtype=Float32, value= 0))

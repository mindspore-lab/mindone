        r"""
        Instantiate a pretrained MindSpore model from a pretrained model configuration.

        The model is set in evaluation mode - `model.eval()` - by default, and dropout modules are deactivated. To
        train the model, set it back in training mode with `model.train()`.

        Parameters:
            pretrained_model_name_or_path (`str` or `os.PathLike`, *optional*):
                Can be either:

                    - A string, the *model id* (for example `google/ddpm-celebahq-256`) of a pretrained model hosted on
                      the Hub.
                    - A path to a *directory* (for example `./my_model_directory`) containing the model weights saved
                      with [`~ModelMixin.save_pretrained`].

            cache_dir (`Union[str, os.PathLike]`, *optional*):
                Path to a directory where a downloaded pretrained model configuration is cached if the standard cache
                is not used.
            mindspore_dtype (`mindspore.Type`, *optional*):
                Override the default `mindspore.Type` and load the model with another dtype.
            force_download (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to force the (re-)download of the model weights and configuration files, overriding the
                cached versions if they exist.
            proxies (`Dict[str, str]`, *optional*):
                A dictionary of proxy servers to use by protocol or endpoint, for example, `{'http': 'foo.bar:3128',
                'http://hostname': 'foo.bar:4012'}`. The proxies are used on each request.
            output_loading_info (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to also return a dictionary containing missing keys, unexpected keys and error messages.
            local_files_only(`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether to only load local model weights and configuration files or not. If set to `True`, the model
                won't be downloaded from the Hub.
            token (`str` or *bool*, *optional*):
                The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files. If `True`, the token generated from
                `diffusers-cli login` (stored in `~/.huggingface`) is used.
            revision (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"main"`):
                The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, a commit id, or any identifier
                allowed by Git.
            from_flax (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Load the model weights from a Flax checkpoint save file.
            subfolder (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `""`):
                The subfolder location of a model file within a larger model repository on the Hub or locally.
            mirror (`str`, *optional*):
                Mirror source to resolve accessibility issues if you're downloading a model in China. We do not
                guarantee the timeliness or safety of the source, and you should refer to the mirror site for more
                information.
            max_memory (`Dict`, *optional*):
                A dictionary device identifier for the maximum memory. Will default to the maximum memory available for
                each GPU and the available CPU RAM if unset.
            offload_folder (`str` or `os.PathLike`, *optional*):
                The path to offload weights if `device_map` contains the value `"disk"`.
            offload_state_dict (`bool`, *optional*):
                If `True`, temporarily offloads the CPU state dict to the hard drive to avoid running out of CPU RAM if
                the weight of the CPU state dict + the biggest shard of the checkpoint does not fit. Defaults to `True`
                when there is some disk offload.
            variant (`str`, *optional*):
                Load weights from a specified `variant` filename such as `"fp16"` or `"ema"`. This is ignored when
                loading `from_flax`.
            use_safetensors (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `None`):
                If set to `None`, the `safetensors` weights are downloaded if they're available **and** if the
                `safetensors` library is installed. If set to `True`, the model is forcibly loaded from `safetensors`
                weights. If set to `False`, `safetensors` weights are not loaded.
            disable_mmap ('bool', *optional*, defaults to 'False'):
                Whether to disable mmap when loading a Safetensors model. This option can perform better when the model
                is on a network mount or hard drive, which may not handle the seeky-ness of mmap very well.

        <Tip>

        To use private or [gated models](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/models-gated#gated-models), log-in with
        `huggingface-cli login`. You can also activate the special
        ["offline-mode"](https://huggingface.co/diffusers/installation.html#offline-mode) to use this method in a
        firewalled environment.

        </Tip>

        Example:

        ```py
        from mindone.diffusers import AutoModel

        unet = AutoModel.from_pretrained("runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5", subfolder="unet")
        ```

        If you get the error message below, you need to finetune the weights for your downstream task:

        ```bash
        Some weights of UNet2DConditionModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5 and are newly initialized because the shapes did not match: # noqa
        - conv_in.weight: found shape mindspore.Size([320, 4, 3, 3]) in the checkpoint and mindspore.Size([320, 9, 3, 3]) in the model instantiated
        You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
        ```

    <Tip>

    To save a model state dictionary to the disk, see [`save_torch_state_dict`]. This helper uses
    `split_torch_state_dict_into_shards` under the hood.

    </Tip>

    <Tip warning={true}>

    If one of the model's tensor is bigger than `max_shard_size`, it will end up in its own shard which will have a
    size greater than `max_shard_size`.

    </Tip>

    Args:
        state_dict (`Dict[str, ms.Tensor]`):
            The state dictionary to save.
        filename_pattern (`str`, *optional*):
            The pattern to generate the files names in which the model will be saved. Pattern must be a string that
            can be formatted with `filename_pattern.format(suffix=...)` and must contain the keyword `suffix`
            Defaults to `"model{suffix}.safetensors"`.
        max_shard_size (`int` or `str`, *optional*):
            The maximum size of each shard, in bytes. Defaults to 5GB.

    Returns:
        [`StateDictSplit`]: A `StateDictSplit` object containing the shards and the index to retrieve them.

    >>> import json
    >>> import os

    ...         shard = {tensor: state_dict[tensor] for tensor in tensors}
    ...         safe_save_file(
    ...             shard,

    ...             metadata={"format": "pt"},

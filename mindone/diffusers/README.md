# Make ðŸ¤— DðŸ§¨ffusers run on MindSpore

> State-of-the-art diffusion models for image and audio generation in MindSpore.
> We've tried to provide a completely consistent interface and usage with the [huggingface/diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers).
> Only necessary changes are made to the [huggingface/diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) to make it seamless for users from torch.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is still under active development and many features are not yet well-supported.
> Development progress and plans are detailed in [Roadmap](#Roadmap).
> Any contribution is welcome!

> [!WARNING]
> Due to differences in framework, some APIs will not be identical to [huggingface/diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) in the foreseeable future, see [Limitations](#Limitations) for details.

ðŸ¤— Diffusers is the go-to library for state-of-the-art pretrained diffusion models for generating images, audio, and even 3D structures of molecules. Whether you're looking for a simple inference solution or training your own diffusion models, ðŸ¤— Diffusers is a modular toolbox that supports both. Our library is designed with a focus on [usability over performance](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/conceptual/philosophy#usability-over-performance), [simple over easy](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/conceptual/philosophy#simple-over-easy), and [customizability over abstractions](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/conceptual/philosophy#tweakable-contributorfriendly-over-abstraction).

ðŸ¤— Diffusers offers three core components:

- State-of-the-art [diffusion pipelines](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/overview) that can be run in inference with just a few lines of code.
- Interchangeable noise [schedulers](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/schedulers/overview) for different diffusion speeds and output quality.
- Pretrained [models](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/models/overview) that can be used as building blocks, and combined with schedulers, for creating your own end-to-end diffusion systems.

## Quickstart

Generating outputs is super easy with ðŸ¤— Diffusers. To generate an image from text, use the `from_pretrained` method to load any pretrained diffusion model (browse the [Hub](https://huggingface.co/models?library=diffusers&sort=downloads) for 19000+ checkpoints):

```diff
- from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline
+ from mindone.diffusers import DiffusionPipeline

pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0",
-    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
+    mindspore_dtype=mindspore.float16
    use_safetensors=True
)

prompt = "An astronaut riding a green horse"

images = pipe(prompt=prompt)[0][0]
```

You can also dig into the models and schedulers toolbox to build your own diffusion system:

```python
from mindone.diffusers import DDPMScheduler, UNet2DModel
from PIL import Image
from mindspore import ops

scheduler = DDPMScheduler.from_pretrained("google/ddpm-cat-256")
model = UNet2DModel.from_pretrained("google/ddpm-cat-256")
scheduler.set_timesteps(50)

sample_size = model.config.sample_size
noise = ops.randn((1, 3, sample_size, sample_size))
input = noise

for t in scheduler.timesteps:
    noisy_residual = model(input, t)[0]
    prev_noisy_sample = scheduler.step(noisy_residual, t, input)[0]
    input = prev_noisy_sample

image = (input / 2 + 0.5).clamp(0, 1)
image = image.permute(0, 2, 3, 1).numpy()[0]
image = Image.fromarray((image * 255).round().astype("uint8"))
image
```

Check out the [Quickstart](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/quicktour) to launch your diffusion journey today!

## Roadmap

In short, only the model, scheduler, pipeline and the training code related to StableDiffusionXL are currently available.
Most base, utility and mixin class are available.

### Pipeline
- [x] DDIMPipeline
- [x] DDPMPipeline
- [x] StableDiffusionXLPipeline
- [ ] StableDiffusionPipeline

### Model
- [x] AutoencoderKL
- [x] Transformer2DModel
- [x] UNet2DConditionModel

### Scheduler
- [x] DDIMScheduler/DDPMScheduler/...(30)
- [ ] DPMSolverSDEScheduler

### Loader
- [ ] LoRA
- [ ] FromSingleFileMixin

## Limitations

### `from_pretrained`
- `torch_dtype` is renamed to `mindspore_dtype`
- `device_map`, `max_memory`, `offload_folder`, `offload_state_dict`, `low_cpu_mem_usage` will not be supported.

### `BaseOutput`

- Default value of `return_dict` is changed to `False`, for `GRAPH_MODE` does not allow to construct an instance of it.

### Output of `AutoencoderKL.encode`

Unlike the output `posterior = DiagonalGaussianDistribution(latent)`, which can do sampling by `posterior.sample()`.
We can only output the `latent` and then do sampling through `AutoencoderKL.diag_gauss_dist.sample(latent)`.

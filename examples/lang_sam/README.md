# Language Segment-Anything



This is a MindSpore Implementation of [Language SAM](https://github.com/luca-medeiros/lang-segment-anything).

Language SAM is built on Meta model, Segment Anything Model 2, and the GroundingDINO detection model. Is can be used for object detection and image segmentation given text prompt.

## 🔆 Features

- 📍 **Language SAM** with the following features
    - ✅ Prediction of masks given a static image and a textual prompt.



You contributions are welcome.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Checkpoints

Please download checkpoints using:
```bash
cd checkpoints && \
./download_ckpts.sh && \
cd ..
```

### Image Prediction

`predict_image.py` is a script to infer the mask given an input image and a text prompt. Please download the images for inference first:
```bash
mkdir -p assets
wget -P assets https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luca-medeiros/lang-segment-anything/refs/heads/main/assets/car.jpeg
```
Then run `python predict_image.py`.

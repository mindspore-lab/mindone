# Textual Inversion for Stable Diffusion Finetuning

[An Image is Worth One Word: Personalizing Text-to-Image Generation using Textual Inversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01618)

## Introduction

Textual Inversion is a method to train a pretrained text-to-image model to generate images of a specific unique concept, modify their appearance, or compose them in new roles and novel scenes. It does not require lots of training data, only 3-5 images of a user-provided concept. It does not update the weights of the text-to-image model to learn the new concept, but learns it through new "words" in the embedding space of a frozen text encoder. These new "words" can be composed into natural language sentences, making it plausible to generate personalized visual content.

As shown above, the textual inversion method consists of the following steps:
1. First, it creates a text prompt following some template like **A photo of $S_{*}$**, where $S_{*}$ is a placeholder for the new "word" to be learned.
2. Then, the tokenizer will assign a unique index to this placeholder. This index corresponds to a single embedding vector $v_{*}$ in the embedding lookup table which is trainable, while all other parameters are non-trainable.
3. Lastly, compute the loss function of the generator (e.g., stable diffusion model) and the gradients of the single embedding vector, then update the weights in $v_{*}$ during training steps.

## Preparation

### Dependency
Make sure the following frameworks are installed.

- mindspore 2.1.0 (Ascend 910) / mindspore 2.2.1 (Ascend 910*)

Enter the `example/stable_diffusion_v2` folder and run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Pretrained Models

Pretrained models will be automatically downloaded when launching the training script. See `_version_cfg` in `train_textual_inversion.py` for more information.

Since we use `CLIPTokenizer` from the `transformers` library, please also install this library using:
```bash
pip install transformers>=4.16.0
```

In addition, please prepare the tokenizer `openai/clip-vit-large-patch14` from the [huggingface website](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-large-patch14/tree/main) for the usage of `CLIPTokenizer`. The directory tree of `openai/` folder should be:

```bash
openai/
└── clip-vit-large-patch14
    ├── config.json
    ├── merges.txt
    ├── preprocessor_config.json
    ├── special_tokens_map.json
    ├── tokenizer_config.json
    ├── tokenizer.json
    └── vocab.json
```
### Finetuning Dataset Preparation

Depending on the concept that we want the finetuned model to learn, the datasets can be divided into two groups: the datasets of the same **object** and the datasets of the same **style**.

For **object** dataset, we use the [cat-toy](https://huggingface.co/datasets/diffusers/cat_toy_example) dataset. The dataset contains six images which are shown below.

</p>
<p align="center">

</p>


For **style** dataset, we use the test set of the [`chinese-art`](https://openi.pcl.ac.cn/jasonhuang/mindone/datasets) dataset, which contains 20 images. Some example images are shown below:

</p>

For the details of downloading `chinese-art` dataset, please refer to [LoRA: Text-image Dataset Preparation](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindone/blob/master/examples/stable_diffusion_v2/README.md#dataset-preparation).


The finetuning images of the same dataset should be placed under the same folder, like this:

```text
dir-to-images
├── img1.jpg
├── img2.jpg
├── img3.jpg
├── img4.jpg
└── img5.jpg
```
We name the folder containing the object dataset as `datasets/cat_toy`, and the folder containing the test set of the chinese_art dataset as `datasets/chinese_art`.

## Finetuning

The key arguments for finetuning experiments are explained as follows:
- `num_vectors`: the number of trainable text embeddings for the text encoder. A larger value indicates  a larger capacity. We recommend taking a grid search to find the optimal number of vectors for each training experiment.
- `start_learning_rate`: the initial learning rate for linear decay learning scheduler.
- `max_steps`: the maximum number of training steps, which overwrites the number of training epochs `--epochs`.
- `gradient_accumulation_steps`: the number of gradient accumulation steps. The default value is 4.
- `placeholder_token`: the token $S_{*}$.
- `initializer_token`: the token used to initialize the newly added text embedding.
- `learnable_property`: one of ["object", "style"].
- `scale_lr`: whether to scale the learning rate based on the batch size, gradient accumulation steps, and n cards.

In the following tutorial, we will use SDv1.5 as an example. The hyperparameter configuration file for SDv1.5 is `configs/train/train_config_textual_inversion_v1.yaml`.

> We also support finetuning SDv2.0(2.1) with `configs/train/train_config_textual_inversion_v2.yaml`. Compared with the hyperparameters for SDv1.5, we use a smaller learning rate (x0.5) and train more steps (x2.0) for SDv2.0 since SDv2.0 is more likely to overfit.

### Object Dataset Experiment

The optimal hyperparameters for the cat-toy dataset with SDv1.5 are `num_vectors=3`, `start_learning_rate=1e-4`, and `max_steps=3000`. See `configs/train/train_config_textual_inversion_v1.yaml` for more information.


The standalone training command for SDv1.5 finetuning on the cat-toy dataset:
```bash
python train_textual_inversion.py \
    --train_config configs/train/train_config_textual_inversion_v1.yaml  \
    --output_path="output/"
```

Suppose the saved checkpoint file is `output/weights/SDv1.5_textual_inversion_3000_ti.ckpt`, we use the following command to run inference with the newly learned text embedding.
```bash
python text_to_image.py  \
    --version "1.5" \
    --prompt "a <cat-toy> backpack" \
    --config configs/v1-train-textual-inversion.yaml  \
    --ti_ckpt_path output/weights/SDv1.5_textual_inversion_3000_ti.ckpt \
    --output_path vis/
```

The generated images using the prompt "a \<cat-toy\> backpack" are show below:

### Style Dataset Experiment

For chinese-art dataset, we need to first change the key arguments in `configs/train/train_config_textual_inversion_v1.yaml` as follows:

```python
train_data_dir: "datasets/chinese_art"
placeholder_token: "<chinese-art>"
initializer_token: "art"
learnable_property: "style"
num_vectors: 1
...
max_steps:4000
```

Then, we can use the following command for training:
```bash
python train_textual_inversion.py  \
    --train_config configs/train/train_config_textual_inversion_v1.yaml  \
    --output_path="output/chinese_art"
```

After training, suppose we have the saved checkpoint file `output/chinese_art/weights/SDv1.5_textual_inversion_4000_ti.ckpt`, we use the following command to run inference with the newly learned text embedding.
```bash
python text_to_image.py  \
    --version "1.5" \
    --prompt "a dog in <chinese-art> style" \
    --config configs/v1-train-textual-inversion.yaml  \
    --ti_ckpt_path output/chinese_art/weights/SDv1.5_textual_inversion_4000_ti.ckpt \
    --output_path vis/
```
The generated images using the prompt "a dog in \<chinese-art\> style" are show below:

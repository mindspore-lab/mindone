## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Checkpoints

Please download all checkpoints and convert them into MindSpore checkpoints following this [instruction](./docs/checkpoints_docs.md).

### Run VAE reconstruction

To run a video reconstruction task using the CausalVAE, please use the following command:
```bash
python scripts/run_vae.py \
    --video-path "path/to/input_video.mp4" \
    --rec-path "reconstructed_video.mp4" \
    --height 336 \
    --width 336 \
    --num-frames 65 \
```
The reconstructed video is saved under `./save_samples/`. To run reconstruction on an input image or a input folder of videos, please refer to `scripts/vae/recon_image.sh` or `scripts/vae/recon_video_folder.sh`.


### Run Text-to-Video Inference

To run the text-to-video inference on a single prompt, please use the following command:
```bash
bash scripts/hyvideo/run_t2v_sample.sh
```
If you want change to another prompt, please set `--prompt` to the new prompt.

If you want to run T2V inference using sequence parallel (Ulysses SP), please use `scripts/hyvideo/run_t2v_sample_sp.sh`. You can revise the SP size using `--sp-size`, which should be aligned with `ASCEND_RT_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, `--worker_num` and `--local_worker_num`. See more usage information about `msrun` from this [website](https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/r2.5.0/model_train/parallel/msrun_launcher.html).

### Run Image-to-Video Inference

Please find more information about HunyuanVideo Image-to-Video Inference at this [url](https://github.com/mindspore-lab/mindone/tree/master/examples/hunyuanvideo-i2v).

## ðŸ”‘ Training

In this section, we provide instructions on how to train the HunyuanVideo model. For training instructions for 3D-VAE, please refer to [this document](docs/3d_vae_docs.md).

### Dataset Preparation

To prepare the dataset for training HunyuanVideo, please refer to the [dataset format](./docs/dataset_docs.md).

### Extract Text Embeddings

You need to extract the text embeddings for the train and validation dataset using the following command respectively:
```bash
python scripts/run_text_encoder.py \
  --data-file-path /path/to/caption.csv \
  --output-path /path/to/text_embed_folder \
```
Please refer to `scripts/text_encoder/run_text_encoder.sh` for more details.

Please also extract the text embedding for an empty string, because it will be used during training when the prompt is dropped randomly.
```bash
python scripts/run_text_encoder.py \
  --prompt "" \
  --output-path /path/to/text_embed_folder \
```

### Extract VAE Lantent Cache

To extract the latent cache for the train and validation dataset, please use the following command respectively:
```bash
WIDTH=256
HEIGHT=256
python scripts/run_vae_cache.py \
  --input-video-dir /path/to/video_folder \
  --latent-cache-dir /path/to/latent_cache_folder \
  --height $HEIGHT \
  --width $WIDTH \
  --vae-tiling \
```
Please set the `--input-video-dir` and `--latent-cache-dir` to specify the input video folder and the output latent cache folder.

### Distributed Training

To run stage 1 (256px) trainig with HunyuanVideo (13B) on multiple NPUs, we use ZeRO3 and data parallelism with the following script:

```bash
bash scripts/hyvideo/train_t2v_stage1.sh
```

To run stage 2 (512px) trainig with HunyuanVideo (13B) on multiple NPUs using Ulysses SP, please run the following command:

```bash
bash scripts/hyvideo/train_t2v_stage2.sh
```

### Finetuning Experiment

For the finetuning experiment with a small dataset, please refer to `scripts/hyvideo/train_t2v_256x256x29_finetune.sh`.

If you want to train with Sequence Parallel (Ulysses SP) and VAE latent cache, please run the [Extract Text Embeddings](#extract-text-embeddings) and [Extract VAE Lantent Cache](#extract-vae-lantent-cache) first.

Then you can refer to `scripts/hyvideo/train_t2v_544x960x129_finetune.sh` or `scripts/hyvideo/train_t2v_720x1280x129_finetune.sh`.

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation

### VAE Reconstruction Evaluation

To run video reconstruction on a folder of videos, please refer to `scripts/vae/recon_video_folder.sh`.

To evaluate the PSNR score between the real and the reconsturcted videos, you may use `scripts/eval/script/cal_psnr.sh`.

To specify the mindspore checkpoint path, please use `--ms-checkpoint`. See more usage information using `python scripts/run_vae.py --help`.

### Text-to-Video Evalution

After training, the checkpoint shards will be saved under `output/experiment_dir/`. The folder structure is as follows:
```bash
output/experiment_dir/
â”œâ”€â”€â”€rank_0
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€ckpt/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€â”€HYVideo-T-2-cfgdistill-s10000.ckpt
â”œâ”€â”€â”€rank_1
â”‚   â””â”€â”€â”€ckpt/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€â”€HYVideo-T-2-cfgdistill-s10000.ckpt
...
â””â”€â”€â”€rank_7
    â””â”€â”€â”€ckpt/
        â””â”€â”€â”€HYVideo-T-2-cfgdistill-s10000.ckpt
```


To run Text-to-Video evaluation with the saved checkpoint shards, please refer to `scripts/hyvideo/run_t2v_sample_multi.sh`. You need to change the `--dit-weight` to the saved checkpoint path, for example:
```bash
--dit-weight "output/experiment_dir/rank_*/ckpt/HYVideo-T-2-cfgdistill-s10000.ckpt"
```

A wildcard pattern `*` is needed to match any rank ids of the checkpoint shards.

### 3D-VAE Training

```


## Inference

### CausalVAE Command Line Inference

You can run video-to-video reconstruction task using `scripts/causalvae/reconstruction.sh`:
```bash
python examples/rec_imvi_vae.py \
    --model_path LanguageBind/Open-Sora-Plan-v1.1.0/vae \
    --video_path test.mp4 \
    --rec_path rec.mp4 \
    --device Ascend \
    --sample_rate 1 \
    --num_frames 513 \
    --resolution 256 \
    --crop_size 256 \
    --ae CausalVAEModel_4x8x8
```
Please change the `--video_path` to the existing video file path and `--rec_path` to the reconstructed video file path. You can set `--grid` to save the original video and the reconstructed video in the same output file.

You can also run video reconstruction given an input video folder. See `scripts/causalvae/gen_video.sh`.

### Open-Sora-Plan v1.1.0 Command Line Inference

You can run text-to-video inference on a single Ascend device using the script `scripts/text_condition/sample_video_65.sh` or `scripts/text_condition/sample_video_221.sh`.
```bash
python opensora/sample/sample_t2v.py \
    --model_path LanguageBind/Open-Sora-Plan-v1.1.0 \
    --text_encoder_name DeepFloyd/t5-v1_1-xxl \
    --text_prompt examples/prompt_list_65.txt \
    --ae CausalVAEModel_4x8x8 \
    --version 65x512x512 \
    --num_frames 65 \
    --height 512 \
    --width 512 \
    --save_img_path "./sample_videos/prompt_list_65" \
    --fps 24 \
    --guidance_scale 7.5 \
    --num_sampling_steps 150 \
    --enable_tiling
```
You can change the `version` to `221x512x512` to change the number of frames and resolutions.

> In case of OOM error, there are two options:
> 1. Pass `--enable_time_chunk True` to allow vae decoding temporal frames as small, overlapped chunks. This can reduce the memory usage, which sacrificies a bit of temporal consistency.
> 2. Seperate the inference into two stages. In stage 1, please run inference with `--save_latents`. This will save some `.npy` files in the output directory. Then in stage 2, please run the same inference script with `--decode_latents`. The generated videos will be saved in the output directory.

If you want to run a multi-device inference, e.g., 8 cards, please use `msrun` and pass `--use_parallel=True` as the example below:

```bash
# 8 NPUs
msrun --master_port=8200 --worker_num=8 --local_worker_num=8 --log_dir="output_log"  \
    python opensora/sample/sample_t2v.py \
    --use_parallel True \
    ... # pass other arguments
```

The command above will run a 8-card inference and save the log files into "output_log". `--master_port` specifies the Scheduler binding port number. `--worker_num` and `--local_worker_num` should be the same to the number of running devices, e.g., 8.

In case of the following error:
```bash
RuntimtError: Failed to register the compute graph node: 0. Reason: Repeated registration node: 0
```

Please edit the `master_port` to a different port number in the range 1024 to 65535, and run the script again.


## Training

### Causal Video VAE

#### Preparation

To train the causal vae model, you need to prepare a video dataset. You can download this video dataset from [Open-Sora-Dataset-v1.1.0](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LanguageBind/Open-Sora-Plan-v1.1.0/tree/main).

Causal video vae can be initialized from vae 2d for better convergence. This can be done by inflating the 2d vae model checkpoint as follows:

```
python tools/model_conversion/inflate_vae2d_to_vae3d.py \
    --src /path/to/vae_2d.ckpt  \
    --target pretrained/causal_vae_488_init.ckpt
```
> In case you lack vae 2d checkpoint in mindspore format, please use `tools/model_conversion/convert_vae.py` for model conversion, e.g. after downloading the [sd-vae-ft-mse](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sd-vae-ft-mse/tree/main) weights.

Please also download [lpips_vgg-426bf45c.ckpt](https://download-mindspore.osinfra.cn/toolkits/mindone/autoencoders/lpips_vgg-426bf45c.ckpt) and put it under `pretrained/` for training with lpips loss.

#### Standalone Training

To launch a single-card training, you can refer to `scripts/causalvae/train.sh`. Please revise the `--video_path` to the path of the folder where the videos are stored, and run:
```bash
bash scripts/causalvae/train.sh
```

#### Multi-Device Training

For parallel training, please use `msrun` and pass `--use_parallel=True`.
```bash
# 8 NPUs
msrun --master_port=8200 --worker_num=8 --local_worker_num=8 --log_dir="output_log"  \
    python opensora/train/train_causalvae.py  \
    --use_parallel True \
    ... # pass other arguments
```

### Training Diffusion Model

#### Preparation

The first-stage training depends on the `t2v.pt` from [Vchitect/Latte](https://huggingface.co/maxin-cn/Latte/tree/main). Please download `t2v.pt` and place it under `LanguageBind/Open-Sora-Plan-v1.1.0/t2v.pt`. Then run model conversion with:
```bash
python tools/model_conversion/convert_latte.py \
  --src pretrained/t2v.pt \
  --target LanguageBind/Open-Sora-Plan-v1.1.0/t2v.ckpt
```

The [Open-Sora-Dataset-v1.1.0](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LanguageBind/Open-Sora-Plan-v1.1.0/tree/main) includes three image datasets and three video datasets, as recorded in `scripts/train_data/image_data.txt` and `scripts/train_data/video_data.txt`. Each line includes the paths to three folders/files: the video folder, the t5 embedding cache folder, and the path to the annotation json file.
For acceleration, we pre-compute the t5 embedding before training the diffusion transformer.

```bash
python opensora/sample/sample_text_embed.py \
    --data_file_path /path/to/video_caption.json \
    --output_path /path/to/text_embed_folder \
```

After running, the text embeddings saved as npz file for each caption will be in `output_path`. Please revise `scripts/train_data/image_data.txt` and `scripts/train_data/video_data.txt` accordingly.

#### Example of Training Scripts
Here we choose an example of training scripts (`train_videoae_65x512x512.sh`) and explain the meanings of some experimental arguments.

There some hyper-parameters that may vary between different experiments:
```shell
image_size=512  # the image size of frames, same to image height and image width
use_image_num=4  # to include n number of images in an input sample
num_frames=65  # to sample m frames from a single video. The total number of images： num_frames + use_image_num
model_dtype="bf16" # the data type used for mixed precision of the diffusion transformer model (LatteT2V).
amp_level="O2" # the default auto mixed precision level for LatteT2V.
enable_flash_attention="True" # whether to use MindSpore Flash Attention
batch_size=2 # training batch size
lr="2e-05" # learning rate. Default learning schedule is constant
```

Here is the major command of the parallel-training script:
```shell
msrun --bind_core=True --worker_num=8 --local_worker_num=8 --master_port=9000 --log_dir=$output_dir/parallel_logs opensora/train/train_t2v.py \
      --video_data "scripts/train_data/video_data.txt" \
      --image_data "scripts/train_data/image_data.txt" \
      --pretrained LanguageBind/Open-Sora-Plan-v1.1.0/t2v.ckpt \
    ... # pass other arguments
```
We use `msrun` to launch the parallel training tasks. For single-node multi-device training, `worker_num` and `local_worker_num` should be the same to the number of training devices.  `master_port` specifies the scheduler binding port number.

There are some arguments related to the training dataset path:
- `video_data` or `image_data`: the text file to the video/image dataset. The text file should contain N lines corresponding to N datasets. Each line should have two or three items. If two items are available, they correspond to the video folder and the annotation json file. If three items are available, they correspond to the video folder, the text embedding cache folder, and the annotation json file.
- `pretrained`: the pretrained checkpoint to be loaded as initial weights before training.

#### Parallel Training

Before launching the first-stage training, please make sure you set the text embedding cache folder correctly in `image_data.txt` and `video_data.txt`.

```bash
# start 65x512x512 pretraining, 8 NPUs
bash scripts/text_condition/train_videoae_65x512x512.sh
```
After the first-stage training, there will be multiple checkpoint shards saved in the `output_dir/ckpt`. Please run the following command to combine the multiple checkpoint shards into a full one:
```
python tools/ckpt/combine_ckpt.py --src output_dir/ckpt --dest output_dir/ckpt --strategy_ckpt output_dir/src_strategy.ckpt
```
Afterwards, you will obtain a full checkpoint file under `output_dir/ckpt/rank_0/full_0.ckpt`.
> If you want to run inference with this full checkpoint file, please revise the script `scripts/text_condition/sample_video.sh` and append `--pretrained_ckpt output_dir/ckpt_full/rank_0/full_0.ckpt` to the end of the inference command.

Then please revise `scripts/text_condition/train_videoae_221x512x512.sh`, and change `--pretrained` to the full checkpoint path from the `65x512x512` stage. Then run:

```bash
# start 221x512x512 finetuning, 8 NPUs
bash scripts/text_condition/train_videoae_221x512x512.sh
```
Simiarly, please revise the `--pretrained` to the full checkpoint path from the `221x512x512` stage, and then start the third-stage training (to be released soon).

#### Performance

We evaluated the training performance on MindSpore and Ascend NPUs. The results are as follows.

| Model           | Context        | Precision | BS | NPUs | num_frames + num_images| Resolution  | Train T. (s/step) |
|:----------------|:---------------|:----------|:--:|:----:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:--------------:|
| LatteT2V-XL/122 | D910\*x1-MS2.3_master(0615daily), CANN C18(0517) | BF16      | 2  |  8   |   17 + 4    | 512x512     |  2.6  |
| LatteT2V-XL/122 | D910\*x1-MS2.3_master(0615daily), CANN C18(0517) | BF16      | 2  |  8   |   65 + 16   | 512x512     |  12.4  |

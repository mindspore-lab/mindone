## Model Weights

### Open-Sora-Plan v1.2.0 Model Weights

Please download the torch checkpoint of mT5-xxl from [google/mt5-xxl](https://huggingface.co/google/mt5-xxl/tree/main), and download the opensora v1.2.0 models' weights from [LanguageBind/Open-Sora-Plan-v1.2.0](https://huggingface.co/LanguageBind/Open-Sora-Plan-v1.2.0/tree/main). Place them under `examples/opensora_pku` as shown below:
```bash
opensora_pku

        └───tokenizer_config.json
```

Currently, we can load `.safetensors` files directly in MindSpore, but not `.bin` or `.ckpt` files. If you have `torch` installed, you can skip the inference section.

If you don't have `torch` installed, we recommend you to manually convert `google/mt5-xxl/pytorch_model.bin` and `vae/checkpoint` using the huggingface [convert](https://huggingface.co/spaces/safetensors/convert) website. You should convert them into `model.safetensors` and place them into corresponding folder.

Once the checkpoint files have all been prepared, you can refer to the inference guidance below.

## Inference

### CausalVAE Command Line Inference

You can run video-to-video reconstruction task using `scripts/causalvae/rec_video.sh`:
```bash
python examples/rec_video.py \
    --ae_path LanguageBind/Open-Sora-Plan-v1.2.0/vae \
    --video_path test.mp4 \
    --rec_path rec.mp4 \
    --device Ascend \
    --sample_rate 1 \
    --num_frames 65 \
    --height 480 \
    --width 640 \
    --enable_tiling \
    --tile_overlap_factor 0.125 \
    --save_memory
```
Please change the `--video_path` to the existing video file path and `--rec_path` to the reconstructed video file path. You can set `--grid` to save the original video and the reconstructed video in the same output file.

You can also run video reconstruction given an input video folder. See `scripts/causalvae/rec_video_folder.sh`.

### Open-Sora-Plan v1.2.0 Command Line Inference

You can run text-to-video inference on a single Ascend device using the script `scripts/text_condition/single-device/sample_t2v.sh`.
```bash
python opensora/sample/sample_t2v.py \
    --model_path LanguageBind/Open-Sora-Plan-v1.2.0/29x720p \
    --num_frames 29 \
    --height 720 \
    --width 1280 \
    --cache_dir "./" \
    --text_encoder_name google/mt5-xxl \
    --text_prompt examples/prompt_list_0.txt \
    --ae CausalVAEModel_D4_4x8x8  \
    --ae_path LanguageBind/Open-Sora-Plan-v1.2.0/vae\
    --save_img_path "./sample_videos/prompt_list_0_29x720p" \
    --fps 24 \
    --guidance_scale 7.5 \
    --num_sampling_steps 100 \
    --enable_tiling \
    --max_sequence_length 512 \
    --sample_method EulerAncestralDiscrete \
    --model_type "dit" \
```
You can change the `num_frames`, `height` and `width` to match with the training shape of different checkpoints, e.g., `29x480p` requires `num_frames=29`, `height=480` and `width=640`. In case of oom on your device, you can try to append `--save_memory` to the command above, which enables a more radical tiling strategy for causal vae.


If you want to run a multi-device inference, e.g., 8 cards, please use `msrun` and pass `--use_parallel=True` as the example below:

```bash
# 8 NPUs
msrun --master_port=8200 --worker_num=8 --local_worker_num=8 --log_dir="output_log"  \
    python opensora/sample/sample_t2v.py \
    --use_parallel True \
    ... # pass other arguments
```

The command above will run a 8-card inference and save the log files into "output_log". `--master_port` specifies the scheduler binding port number. `--worker_num` and `--local_worker_num` should be the same to the number of running devices, e.g., 8.

In case of the following error:
```bash
RuntimtError: Failed to register the compute graph node: 0. Reason: Repeated registration node: 0
```

Please edit the `master_port` to a different port number in the range 1024 to 65535, and run the script again.


## Training

### Causal Video VAE

#### Preparation

**Step 1: Downloading Datasets**:

To train the causal vae model, you need to prepare a video dataset. Open-Sora-Plan-v1.2.0 trains vae in two stages. In the first stage, the authors trained vae on the Kinetic400 video dataset. Please download K400 dataset from [this repository](https://github.com/cvdfoundation/kinetics-dataset). In the second stage, they trained vae on Open-Sora-Dataset-v1.1.0. We give a tutorial on how to download the v1.1.0 datasets. See [downloading tutorial](./tools/download/README.md).

**Step 2: Converting Pretrained Weights**:

As with v1.1.0, they initialized from the [SD2.1 VAE](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sd-vae-ft-mse) using tail initialization for better convergence. Please download the torch weight file from the given [URL](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sd-vae-ft-mse/tree/main).

After downloading the [sd-vae-ft-mse](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sd-vae-ft-mse/tree/main) weights, you can run:
```bash
python tools/model_conversion/convert_vae_2d.py --src path/to/diffusion.safetensor --target /path/to/sd-vae-ft-mse.ckpt`.
```
This can convert the torch weight file into mindspore weight file.

They you can inflate the 2d vae model checkpoint into a 3d causal vae initial weight file as follows:

```bash
python tools/model_conversion/inflate_vae2d_to_vae3d.py \
    --src /path/to/sd-vae-ft-mse.ckpt  \
    --target pretrained/causal_vae_488_init.ckpt
```

In order to train vae with lpips loss, please also download [lpips_vgg-426bf45c.ckpt](https://download-mindspore.osinfra.cn/toolkits/mindone/autoencoders/lpips_vgg-426bf45c.ckpt) and put it under `pretrained/`.

#### Standalone Training

After downloading the datasets and preparing the pretrained weight, you can revise the `--video_path` in the training script to the video folder path of your downloaded dataset. This will allow the training script to load all video files under `video_path` in a **recursive manner**, and use them as the training data. Make sure the `--load_from_checkpoint` is set to the pretrained weight, e.g., `pretrained/causal_vae_488_init.ckpt`.


<details>
<summary>How to define the train and test set?</summary>

If you need to define the video files in the training set, please use a csv file with only one column, like:
```csv
"video"
folder_name/video_name_01.mp4
folder_name/video_name_02.mp4
...
```
Afterwards, you should revise the training script as below:
```bash
python opensora/train/train_causalvae.py \
    --data_file_path path/to/train_set/csv/file \
    --video_column "video" \
    --video_path path/to/downloaded/dataset \
    # pass other arguments
```

Similarly, you can create a csv file to include the test set videos, and pass the csv file to `--data_file_path` in `examples/rec_video_vae.py`.
</details>

To launch a single-card training using perceputal loss, you can refer to `scripts/causalvae/train_without_gan_loss.sh` and run:
```bash
bash scripts/causalvae/train_without_gan_loss.sh
```

If you want to train causalvae with perceputal loss and GAN loss, you can refer to `scripts/causalvae/train_with_gan_loss.sh`.

> Note:
> - Supports resume training by setting `--resume_training_checkpoint True`. It is the same for the multi-device training script.

#### Multi-Device Training

For parallel training, please use `msrun` and pass `--use_parallel=True`.
```bash
# 8 NPUs
msrun --master_port=8200 --worker_num=8 --local_worker_num=8 --log_dir="output_log"  \
    python opensora/train/train_causalvae.py  \
    --use_parallel True \
    ... # pass other arguments, please refer to the single-device training script.
```
For more details, please take `scripts/causalvae/train_with_gan_loss_multi_device.sh` as an example.


#### Inference After Training

After training, you will find the checkpoint files under the `ckpt/` folder of the output directory. To evaluate the reconstruction of the checkpoint file, you can take `scripts/causalvae/rec_video_folder.sh` and revise it like:

```bash
python examples/rec_video_folder.py \
    --batch_size 1 \
    --real_video_dir input_real_video_dir \
    --generated_video_dir output_generated_video_dir \
    --device Ascend \
    --sample_fps 10 \
    --sample_rate 1 \
    --num_frames 65 \
    --height 480 \
    --width 640 \
    --num_workers 8 \
    --ae_path LanguageBind/Open-Sora-Plan-v1.2.0/vae \
    --enable_tiling \
    --tile_overlap_factor 0.125 \
    --save_memory \
    --ms_checkpoint /path/to/ms/checkpoint \
```

Runing this command will generate reconstructed videos under the given `output_generated_video_dir`. You can then evalute some common metrics (e.g., ssim, psnr) using the script under `opensora/eval/script`.



### Training Diffusion Model

#### Preparation

**Step 1: Downloading Datasets**:


The [Open-Sora-Dataset-v1.2.0](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LanguageBind/Open-Sora-Plan-v1.2.0) contains annotation json files, which are listed below:

```text
Panda70M_HQ1M.json
Panda70M_HQ6M.json
sam_image_11185255_resolution.json
v1.1.0_HQ_part1.json
v1.1.0_HQ_part2.json
v1.1.0_HQ_part3.json
```

Please check the [readme doc](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LanguageBind/Open-Sora-Plan-v1.2.0) for details of these annotation files. [Open-Sora-Dataset-v1.2.0](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LanguageBind/Open-Sora-Plan-v1.2.0) also utilizes the data from [Open-Sora-Dataset-v1.1.0](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LanguageBind/Open-Sora-Plan-v1.1.0/tree/main). You can take the following instructions only how to download [Open-Sora-Dataset-v1.1.0](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LanguageBind/Open-Sora-Plan-v1.1.0/tree/main).


<details>
<summary> How to download Open-Sora-Dataset-v1.1.0? </summary>
The [Open-Sora-Dataset-v1.1.0](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LanguageBind/Open-Sora-Plan-v1.1.0/tree/main) includes three image-text datasets and three video-text datasets. As reported in [Report v1.1.0](https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/Open-Sora-Plan/blob/main/docs/Report-v1.1.0.md), the three image-text datasets are:
| Name | Image Source | Text Captioner | Num pair |
|---|---|---|---|
| SAM-11M | [SAM](https://ai.meta.com/datasets/segment-anything/) |  [LLaVA](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA) |  11,185,255 |
| Anytext-3M-en | [Anytext](https://github.com/tyxsspa/AnyText) |  [InternVL-1.5](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/InternVL) |  1,886,137 |
| Human-160k | [Laion](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/) |  [InternVL-1.5](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/InternVL) |  162,094 |


The three video-text datasets are:
| Name | Hours | Num frames | Num pair |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Mixkit](https://mixkit.co/) | 42.0h |  65 |  54,735 |
|   |  |  513 |  1,997 |
| [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) | 353.3h |  65 | 601,513 |
|   |  |  513 |  51,483 |
| [Pexel](https://www.pexels.com/) | 2561.9h |  65 |  3,832,666 |
|   |  |  513 |  271,782 |

Each video-text dataset has two annotation json files. For example, the mixkit dataset has `video_mixkit_65f_54735.json` which includes $54735$ video(65 frames)-text pairs and `video_mixkit_513f_1997.json` which includes $1997$ video(513 frames)-text pairs. The annotation json contains three keys: `path` corresponding to the video path, `cap` corresponding to the caption, and `frame_idx` corresponding to the frame indexes range. An example of annotation json file is shown below:

```json
[
  {
    "path": "Fish/mixkit-multicolored-coral-shot-with-fish-projections-4020.mp4",
    "frame_idx": "0:513",
    "cap": "The video presents a continuous exploration of a vibrant underwater coral environment,...",
  }
  ...
]
```


To prepare the training datasets, please first download the video and image datasets in [Open-Sora-Dataset-v1.1.0](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LanguageBind/Open-Sora-Plan-v1.1.0/tree/main). We give a tutorial on how to download these datasets. See [downloading tutorial](./tools/download/README.md).

You need to download **at least one video dataset and one image dataset** to enable video-image joint training. After downloading all datasets, you can place images/videos under the folder `datasets`, which looks like:
```bash
datasets/
├───images/  # Human-160k
├───anytext3m/  # Anytext-3M-en
├───sam/  # SAM-11M
├───pixabay_v2/  # Pixabay
├───pexels/  # Pexel
└───mixkit/  # Mixkit
```
You can place the json files under the folder `anno_jsons`. The folder structure is:
```bash
anno_jsons/
├───video_pixabay_65f_601513.json
├───video_pixabay_513f_51483.json
├───video_pexel_65f_3832666.json
├───video_pexel_513f_271782.json

├───human_images_162094.json
├───anytext_en_1886137.json
└───sam_image_11185255.json
```
</details>


**Step 2: Extracting Embedding Cache**:

Next, please extract the text embeddings and save them in the disk for training acceleration. For each json file, you need to run the following command accordingly and save the t5 embeddings cache in the `output_path`.  

```bash
python opensora/sample/sample_text_embed.py \
    --data_file_path /path/to/caption.json \
    --output_path /path/to/text_embed_folder \
```

The text embeddings are extracted and saved under the specified `output_path`.

**Step 3: Revising the Paths**:

After extracting the embedding cache, you will have the following three paths ready:
```text
images/videos path: e.g., datasets/panda70m/
text embedding path: e.g., datasets/panda70m_emb-len=512/
annotation json path: e.g., datasets/anno_jsons/Panda70M_HQ1M.json
```
In the dataset file, for example, `scripts/train_data/merge_data.txt`, each line represents one dataset. Each line includes three paths: the images/videos folder, the text embedding cache folder, and the path to the annotation json file. Please revise them accordingly to the paths on your disk.


#### Example of Training Scripts

The training scripts are stored under `scripts/text_condition`. The single-device training scripts are under the `single-device` folder for demonstration. We recommend to use the parallel-training scripts under the `multi-devices` folder.

Here we choose an example of training scripts (`train_video3d_nx480p.sh`) and explain the meanings of some experimental arguments.

Here is the major command of the training script:
```shell
export DEVICE_ID=0
NUM_FRAME=29
python  opensora/train/train_t2v_diffusers.py \
    --data "scripts/train_data/merge_data_panda70m.txt" \
    --num_frames ${NUM_FRAME} \
    --max_height 480 \
    --max_width 640 \
    --attention_mode xformers \
    --gradient_checkpointing \
    --pretrained "path/to/ms-or-safetensors-ckpt/from/last/stage" \
    # pass other arguments
```
There are some arguments related to the training dataset path:
- `data`: the text file to the video/image dataset. The text file should contain N lines corresponding to N datasets. Each line should have two or three items. If two items are available, they correspond to the video folder and the annotation json file. If three items are available, they correspond to the video folder, the text embedding cache folder, and the annotation json file.
- `num_frames`: the number of frames of each video sample.
- `max_height` and `max_width`: the frame maximum height and width.
- `attention_mode`: the attention mode, choosing from `math` or `xformers`. Note that we are not using the actual [xformers](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//github.com/facebookresearch/xformers) library to accelerate training, but using MindSpore-native `FlashAttentionScore`. The `xformers` is kept for compatibility and maybe re-named in the future.
- `gradient_checkpointing`: this is similar to MindSpore [recomputation](https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/r2.3.1/api_python/mindspore/mindspore.recompute.html) feature, which can save memory by recomputing the intermediate activations in the backward pass.
- `pretrained`: the pretrained checkpoint to be loaded as initial weights before training. If not provided, the OpenSoraT2V will use random initialization. If provided, the path should be either the safetensors checkpoint directiory or path, e.g., "LanguageBind/Open-Sora-Plan-v1.2.0/1x480p" or "LanguageBind/Open-Sora-Plan-v1.2.0/1x480p/diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors", or MindSpore checkpoint path, e.g., "t2i-image3d-1x480p/ckpt/OpenSoraT2V-ROPE-L-122.ckpt".

# HunyuanVideo-I2V

This is a **MindSpore** implementation of [HunyuanVideo-I2V](https://github.com/Tencent/HunyuanVideo-I2V). It contains the code for **training** and **inference** of HunyuanVideo and 3D CausalVAE.


## ðŸ“‘ Development Plan

Here is the development plan of the project:

- CausalVAE:
    - [x] Inference
    - [ ] Evalution
    - [ ] Training
- HunyuanVideo (13B):
    - [x] Inference
    - [ ] Training
    - [ ] LoRA finetune

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Checkpoints

Please download all checkpoints and convert them into MindSpore checkpoints following this [instruction](./ckpts/README.md).

### Run VAE reconstruction

To run a video reconstruction task using the CausalVAE, please use the following command:
```bash
python scripts/run_vae.py \
    --video-path "path/to/input_video.mp4" \
    --rec-path "reconstructed_video.mp4" \
    --height 336 \
    --width 336 \
    --num-frames 65 \
```
The reconstructed video is saved under `./save_samples/`. To run reconstruction on an input image or a input folder of videos, please refer to `scripts/vae/recon_image.sh` or `scripts/vae/recon_video_folder.sh`.


<!-- ### Run Text-to-Video Inference

To run the text-to-video inference on a single prompt, please use the following command:
```bash
bash scripts/hyvideo/run_t2v_sample.sh
```
If you want change to another prompt, please set `--prompt` to the new prompt. -->

### Run Image-to-Video Inference

To run the image-to-video inference on a single prompt, please use the following command:
```bash
bash scripts/hyvideo-i2v/run_sample_image2video_stability.sh # or run_sample_image2video_dynamic.sh
```
If you want change to another prompt, please set `--prompt` to the new prompt.

    Args:
        query, key, value: map a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output.
            See "Attention Is All You Need" for more details.
        embed_dim_to_check: total dimension of the model.
        num_heads: parallel attention heads.
        in_proj_weight, in_proj_bias: input projection weight and bias.
        bias_k, bias_v: bias of the key and value sequences to be added at dim=0.
        add_zero_attn: add a new batch of zeros to the key and
                       value sequences at dim=1.
        dropout_p: probability of an element to be zeroed.
        out_proj_weight, out_proj_bias: the output projection weight and bias.
        training: apply dropout if is ``True``.
        key_padding_mask: if provided, specified padding elements in the key will
            be ignored by the attention. This is an binary mask. When the value is True,
            the corresponding value on the attention layer will be filled with -inf.
        need_weights: output attn_output_weights.
        attn_mask: 2D or 3D mask that prevents attention to certain positions. A 2D mask will be broadcasted for all
            the batches while a 3D mask allows to specify a different mask for the entries of each batch.
        use_separate_proj_weight: the function accept the proj. weights for query, key,
            and value in different forms. If false, in_proj_weight will be used, which is
            a combination of q_proj_weight, k_proj_weight, v_proj_weight.
        q_proj_weight, k_proj_weight, v_proj_weight, in_proj_bias: input projection weight and bias.
        static_k, static_v: static key and value used for attention operators.
        average_attn_weights: If true, indicates that the returned ``attn_weights`` should be averaged across heads.
            Otherwise, ``attn_weights`` are provided separately per head. Note that this flag only has an effect
            when ``need_weights=True.``. Default: True


    Shape:
        Inputs:
        - query: :math:`(L, E)` or :math:`(L, N, E)` where L is the target sequence length, N is the batch size, E is
          the embedding dimension.
        - key: :math:`(S, E)` or :math:`(S, N, E)`, where S is the source sequence length, N is the batch size, E is
          the embedding dimension.
        - value: :math:`(S, E)` or :math:`(S, N, E)` where S is the source sequence length, N is the batch size, E is
          the embedding dimension.
        - key_padding_mask: :math:`(S)` or :math:`(N, S)` where N is the batch size, S is the source sequence length.
          If a ByteTensor is provided, the non-zero positions will be ignored while the zero positions
          will be unchanged. If a BoolTensor is provided, the positions with the
          value of ``True`` will be ignored while the position with the value of ``False`` will be unchanged.
        - attn_mask: 2D mask :math:`(L, S)` where L is the target sequence length, S is the source sequence length.
          3D mask :math:`(N*num_heads, L, S)` where N is the batch size, L is the target sequence length,
          S is the source sequence length. attn_mask ensures that position i is allowed to attend the unmasked
          positions. If a ByteTensor is provided, the non-zero positions are not allowed to attend
          while the zero positions will be unchanged. If a BoolTensor is provided, positions with ``True``
          are not allowed to attend while ``False`` values will be unchanged. If a FloatTensor
          is provided, it will be added to the attention weight.
        - static_k: :math:`(N*num_heads, S, E/num_heads)`, where S is the source sequence length,
          N is the batch size, E is the embedding dimension. E/num_heads is the head dimension.
        - static_v: :math:`(N*num_heads, S, E/num_heads)`, where S is the source sequence length,
          N is the batch size, E is the embedding dimension. E/num_heads is the head dimension.

        Outputs:
        - attn_output: :math:`(L, E)` or :math:`(L, N, E)` where L is the target sequence length, N is the batch size,
          E is the embedding dimension.
        - attn_output_weights: Only returned when ``need_weights=True``. If ``average_attn_weights=True``, returns
          attention weights averaged across heads of shape :math:`(L, S)` when input is unbatched or
          :math:`(N, L, S)`, where :math:`N` is the batch size, :math:`L` is the target sequence length, and
          :math:`S` is the source sequence length. If ``average_weights=False``, returns attention weights per
          head of shape :math:`(num_heads, L, S)` when input is unbatched or :math:`(N, num_heads, L, S)`.

# When adding a new object to this init, remember to add it twice: once inside the `_import_structure` dictionary and
# once inside the `if TYPE_CHECKING` branch. The `TYPE_CHECKING` should have import statements as usual, but they are
# only there for type checking. The `_import_structure` is a dictionary submodule to list of object names, and is used
# to defer the actual importing for when the objects are requested. This way `import transformers` provides the names
# in the namespace without actually importing anything (and especially none of the backends).

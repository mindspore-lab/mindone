[**Wan: Open and Advanced Large-Scale Video Generative Models**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20314) <be>


We are excited to introduce **Wan2.2**, a major upgrade to our foundational video models. With **Wan2.2**, we have focused on incorporating the following innovations:

- 👍 **Effective MoE Architecture**: Wan2.2 introduces a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture into video diffusion models. By separating the denoising process cross timesteps with specialized powerful expert models, this enlarges the overall model capacity while maintaining the same computational cost.

- 👍 **Cinematic-level Aesthetics**: Wan2.2 incorporates meticulously curated aesthetic data, complete with detailed labels for lighting, composition, contrast, color tone, and more. This allows for more precise and controllable cinematic style generation, facilitating the creation of videos with customizable aesthetic preferences.

- 👍 **Complex Motion Generation**: Compared to Wan2.1, Wan2.2 is trained on a significantly larger data, with +65.6% more images and +83.2% more videos. This expansion notably enhances the model's generalization across multiple dimensions such as motions,  semantics, and aesthetics, achieving TOP performance among all open-sourced and closed-sourced models.

- 👍 **Efficient High-Definition Hybrid TI2V**:  Wan2.2 open-sources a 5B model built with our advanced Wan2.2-VAE that achieves a compression ratio of **16×16×4**. This model supports both text-to-video and image-to-video generation at 720P resolution with 24fps and can also run on consumer-grade graphics cards like 4090. It is one of the fastest **720P@24fps** models currently available, capable of serving both the industrial and academic sectors simultaneously.

#### Run Text-to-Video Generation

This repository supports the `Wan2.2-T2V-A14B` Text-to-Video model and can simultaneously support video generation at 480P and 720P resolutions.


##### (1) Without Prompt Extension

To facilitate implementation, we will start with a basic version of the inference process that skips the [prompt extension](#2-using-prompt-extention) step.

- Multi-GPU inference using ZeRO3 + DeepSpeed Ulysses

  We use [ZeRO3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02054) and [DeepSpeed Ulysses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14509) to accelerate inference.

``` sh
msrun --worker_num=4 --local_worker_num=4 generate.py --task t2v-A14B --size 1280*720 --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.2-T2V-A14B --dit_zero3 --t5_zero3 --ulysses_size 4 --offload_model True --prompt "Two anthropomorphic cats in comfy boxing gear and bright gloves fight intensely on a spotlighted stage."
```

> 💡To reduce NPU memory usage, you can use the `--convert_model_dtype` options.


##### (2) Using Prompt Extension

Extending the prompts can effectively enrich the details in the generated videos, further enhancing the video quality. Therefore, we recommend enabling prompt extension. We provide the following two methods for prompt extension:

- Using a local model for extension.

  - By default, the Qwen model on HuggingFace is used for this extension. Users can choose Qwen models or other models based on the available NPU memory size.
  - For text-to-video tasks, you can use models like `Qwen/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct`, `Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct` and `Qwen/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct`.
  - For image-to-video tasks, you can use models like `Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct` and `Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct`.
  - Larger models generally provide better extension results but require more GPU memory.
  - You can modify the model used for extension with the parameter `--prompt_extend_model` , allowing you to specify either a local model path or a Hugging Face model. For example:

``` sh
msrun --worker_num=4 --local_worker_num=4 generate.py  --task t2v-A14B --size 1280*720 --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.2-T2V-A14B --dit_zero3 --t5_zero3 --ulysses_size 4 --offload_model True --prompt "Two anthropomorphic cats in comfy boxing gear and bright gloves fight intensely on a spotlighted stage" --use_prompt_extend --prompt_extend_method 'local_qwen' --prompt_extend_target_lang 'zh'
```


#### Run Image-to-Video Generation

This repository supports the `Wan2.2-I2V-A14B` Image-to-Video model and can simultaneously support video generation at 480P and 720P resolutions.


- Multi-GPU inference using ZeRO3 + DeepSpeed Ulysses

```sh
msrun --worker_num=2 --local_worker_num=2 generate.py --task i2v-A14B --size 1280*720 --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.2-I2V-A14B --offload_model True --convert_model_dtype --image ../wan2_1/examples/i2v_input.JPG --prompt "Summer beach vacation style, a white cat wearing sunglasses sits on a surfboard. The fluffy-furred feline gazes directly at the camera with a relaxed expression. Blurred beach scenery forms the background featuring crystal-clear waters, distant green hills, and a blue sky dotted with white clouds. The cat assumes a naturally relaxed posture, as if savoring the sea breeze and warm sunlight. A close-up shot highlights the feline's intricate details and the refreshing atmosphere of the seaside."
```

> 💡For the Image-to-Video task, the `size` parameter represents the area of the generated video, with the aspect ratio following that of the original input image.


- Image-to-Video Generation without prompt

```sh
DASH_API_KEY=your_key torchrun --nproc_per_node=8 generate.py --task i2v-A14B --size 1280*720 --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.2-I2V-A14B --prompt '' --image examples/i2v_input.JPG --dit_zero3 --t5_zero3 --ulysses_size 8 --use_prompt_extend --prompt_extend_method 'dashscope'
```

> 💡The model can generate videos solely from the input image. You can use prompt extension to generate prompt from the image.

#### Run Text-Image-to-Video Generation

This repository supports the `Wan2.2-TI2V-5B` Text-Image-to-Video model and can support video generation at 720P resolutions.


- Single-GPU Text-to-Video inference
```sh
python generate.py --task ti2v-5B --size 1280*704 --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.2-TI2V-5B --convert_model_dtype --prompt "Two anthropomorphic cats in comfy boxing gear and bright gloves fight intensely on a spotlighted stage"
```

> 💡Unlike other tasks, the 720P resolution of the Text-Image-to-Video task is `1280*704` or `704*1280`.


- Single-GPU Image-to-Video inference
```sh
python generate.py --task ti2v-5B --size 1280*704 --ckpt_dir ./Wan2.2-TI2V-5B --convert_model_dtype --image ../wan2_1/examples/i2v_input.JPG --prompt "Summer beach vacation style, a white cat wearing sunglasses sits on a surfboard. The fluffy-furred feline gazes directly at the camera with a relaxed expression. Blurred beach scenery forms the background featuring crystal-clear waters, distant green hills, and a blue sky dotted with white clouds. The cat assumes a naturally relaxed posture, as if savoring the sea breeze and warm sunlight. A close-up shot highlights the feline's intricate details and the refreshing atmosphere of the seaside."
```

> 💡If the image parameter is configured, it is an Image-to-Video generation; otherwise, it defaults to a Text-to-Video generation.

> 💡Similar to Image-to-Video, the `size` parameter represents the area of the generated video, with the aspect ratio following that of the original input image.


- Multi-GPU inference using ZeRO3 + DeepSpeed Ulysses

## Introduction of Wan2.2

**Wan2.2** builds on the foundation of Wan2.1 with notable improvements in generation quality and model capability. This upgrade is driven by a series of key technical innovations, mainly including the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, upgraded training data, and high-compression video generation.

##### (1) Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Architecture

Wan2.2 introduces Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture into the video generation diffusion model. MoE has been widely validated in large language models as an efficient approach to increase total model parameters while keeping inference cost nearly unchanged. In Wan2.2, the A14B model series adopts a two-expert design tailored to the denoising process of diffusion models: a high-noise expert for the early stages, focusing on overall layout; and a low-noise expert for the later stages, refining video details. Each expert model has about 14B parameters, resulting in a total of 27B parameters but only 14B active parameters per step, keeping inference computation and GPU memory nearly unchanged.

<div align="center">
    <img src="assets/moe_arch.png" alt="" style="width: 90%;" />
</div>

The transition point between the two experts is determined by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a metric that decreases monotonically as the denoising step $t$ increases. At the beginning of the denoising process, $t$ is large and the noise level is high, so the SNR is at its minimum, denoted as ${SNR}_{min}$. In this stage, the high-noise expert is activated. We define a threshold step ${t}_{moe}$ corresponding to half of the ${SNR}_{min}$, and switch to the low-noise expert when $t<{t}_{moe}$.

<div align="center">
    <img src="assets/moe_2.png" alt="" style="width: 90%;" />
</div>

To validate the effectiveness of the MoE architecture, four settings are compared based on their validation loss curves. The baseline **Wan2.1** model does not employ the MoE architecture. Among the MoE-based variants, the **Wan2.1 & High-Noise Expert** reuses the Wan2.1 model as the low-noise expert while uses the  Wan2.2's high-noise expert, while the **Wan2.1 & Low-Noise Expert** uses Wan2.1 as the high-noise expert and employ the Wan2.2's low-noise expert. The **Wan2.2 (MoE)** (our final version) achieves the lowest validation loss, indicating that its generated video distribution is closest to ground-truth and exhibits superior convergence.


##### (2) Efficient High-Definition Hybrid TI2V
To enable more efficient deployment, Wan2.2 also explores a high-compression design. In addition to the 27B MoE models, a 5B dense model, i.e., TI2V-5B, is released. It is supported by a high-compression Wan2.2-VAE, which achieves a $T\times H\times W$ compression ratio of $4\times16\times16$, increasing the overall compression rate to 64 while maintaining high-quality video reconstruction. With an additional patchification layer, the total compression ratio of TI2V-5B reaches $4\times32\times32$. Without specific optimization, TI2V-5B can generate a 5-second 720P video in under 9 minutes on a single consumer-grade GPU, ranking among the fastest 720P@24fps video generation models. This model also natively supports both text-to-video and image-to-video tasks within a single unified framework, covering both academic research and practical applications.

    <img src="assets/vae.png" alt="" style="width: 80%;" />
</div>



##### Comparisons to SOTAs
We compared Wan2.2 with leading closed-source commercial models on our new Wan-Bench 2.0, evaluating performance across multiple crucial dimensions. The results demonstrate that Wan2.2 achieves superior performance compared to these leading models.

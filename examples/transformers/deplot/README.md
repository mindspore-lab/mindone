# DePlot

## Overview

DePlot was proposed in the paper [DePlot: One-shot visual language reasoning by plot-to-table translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10505) from Fangyu Liu, Julian Martin Eisenschlos, Francesco Piccinno, Syrine Krichene, Chenxi Pang, Kenton Lee, Mandar Joshi, Wenhu Chen, Nigel Collier, Yasemin Altun.

The abstract of the paper states the following:

*Visual language such as charts and plots is ubiquitous in the human world. Comprehending plots and charts requires strong reasoning skills. Prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) models require at least tens of thousands of training examples and their reasoning capabilities are still much limited, especially on complex human-written queries. This paper presents the first one-shot solution to visual language reasoning. We decompose the challenge of visual language reasoning into two steps: (1) plot-to-text translation, and (2) reasoning over the translated text. The key in this method is a modality conversion module, named as DePlot, which translates the image of a plot or chart to a linearized table. The output of DePlot can then be directly used to prompt a pretrained large language model (LLM), exploiting the few-shot reasoning capabilities of LLMs. To obtain DePlot, we standardize the plot-to-table task by establishing unified task formats and metrics, and train DePlot end-to-end on this task. DePlot can then be used off-the-shelf together with LLMs in a plug-and-play fashion. Compared with a SOTA model finetuned on more than >28k data points, DePlot+LLM with just one-shot prompting achieves a 24.0% improvement over finetuned SOTA on human-written queries from the task of chart QA.*

DePlot is a model that is trained using `Pix2Struct` architecture. You can find more information about `Pix2Struct` in the [Pix2Struct documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/pix2struct).
DePlot is a Visual Question Answering subset of `Pix2Struct` architecture. It renders the input question on the image and predicts the answer.

## Usage example

Currently one checkpoint is available for DePlot:

- `google/deplot`: DePlot fine-tuned on ChartQA dataset


```python
import mindspore as ms
from transformers import AutoProcessor
from mindone.transformers import Pix2StructForConditionalGeneration
import requests
from PIL import Image

model = Pix2StructForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("google/deplot")
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("google/deplot")
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vis-nlp/ChartQA/main/ChartQA%20Dataset/val/png/5090.png"
image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

inputs = processor(images=image, text="Generate underlying data table of the figure below:", return_tensors="np")
inputs = {k: ms.Tensor(v) for k, v in inputs.items()}
predictions = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=512)
print(processor.decode(predictions[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```
